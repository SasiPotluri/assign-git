2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
In git When you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit's history,
Git makes things easier for you by shifting the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to 
merge together, this is known as a fast-forward.

3. Why should you have different branches?
Branching allows the teams to work on multiple tasks on multiple versions simultaneously.
Each developer can work independently on their code and merge their changes later.
It also helps the git to easily merge their codes later on.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
In a project we must have an origin repository. Apart from that we can have as many git repositories as we want.
